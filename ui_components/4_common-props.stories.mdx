	UI Component System Overview : React Common Props & Styling System Props
</h1>

### Overview

Common props are available on all components (provided by Styled Components) while styling props are only potentially available on a component (see a components documentation to see which styling props it accepts).

---

### Common Props

i.e. the common or global React props that are available to all components are:

<ComponentCommonProps />

---

### Styling System Props

To normalize and facilitate the styling of components via React props components can make use of the props provided by [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) which add constraint-based CSS React props to components (e.g., alter the CSS background color of a component via a `bg` React prop).

Below is an example of a `<Foo>` component created using [styled components](https://styled-components.com/) and extended with [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) React props. This arbitrary example should give you an idea of how [Styled System](https://styled-system.com/) props are implemented on React Components created using [styled components](https://styled-components.com/).

The available common styling props are organized into the following catagories:

<ComponentStylingProps />

**Note**: Not all components get all common styling props. The common styling props supported by a component will be listed in the components documentation.
